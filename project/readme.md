## Zettel Pills

### Abstract
Zettel Pills is an oper source rest api application to help people create notes and documentation.

### Introduction to Zettel Pills

Zettel Pills is a structured, web-based application built to help users implement the Zettelkasten method, a proven system for personal knowledge management and long-term idea development. Whether you are a student, researcher, academic, or writer, Zettel Pills provides the digital infrastructure needed to capture, organize, and interlink ideas efficiently and meaningfully.

#### What is Zettelkasten?

The Zettelkasten method, originally developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, is based on the principle of creating atomic notes (or zettels), each containing a single idea. These notes are then systematically linked to form a dynamic and evolving network of thought. Unlike linear note-taking systems, Zettelkasten fosters non-linear thinking, promotes idea emergence through interconnection, and scales with your growing knowledge base.
Purpose of Zettel Pills

Zettel Pills is designed to digitize and enhance the Zettelkasten process through a suite of features that prioritize clarity, connectivity, and discoverability. The application allows users to:

  - Write and manage atomic notes
  - Create bi-directional links between note cards
  - Apply tags and subdivide notes into projects
  - Visualize their knowledge structure via graph views
  - Retrieve and explore information using full-text search

By leveraging modern web technologies and UX principles, Zettel Pills aims to make complex information architectures accessible and intuitive.
